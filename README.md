# million-song-dataset

The [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/) is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.

Its purposes are:

  To encourage research on algorithms that scale to commercial sizes
  
  
  To provide a reference dataset for evaluating research
  
  
  As a shortcut alternative to creating a large dataset with APIs (e.g. The Echo Nest's)
  
  
  To help new researchers get started in the MIR field
  

In this repository I will be using the dataset to do projects with PostgreSQL, Redshift, Spark and Apache Airflow.
